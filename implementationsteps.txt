Below is a step-by-step guide to implement the functionality for the applicant-dashboard.html file:

1. Frontend Enhancements
a. Dynamic Content Loading
Ensure the content object contains all the necessary sections (Profile, Wishlist, Last Seen Offers, Messages).
Dynamically update the main-content area based on the sidebar link clicked.
b. Progress Bar
Ensure the progress bar dynamically updates as the user fills out the profile form.
Use JavaScript to calculate the percentage of completed fields and update the progress bar width and text.
c. Messaging Interface
Add a conversation list and chat window to the Messages section.
Ensure the chat window dynamically loads messages for the selected conversation.
Allow users to send new messages using the message form.
2. Backend Implementation
a. API Endpoints
Implement the following backend endpoints to support the functionality:

GET /api/conversations

Fetch the list of conversations for the logged-in user.
Response example:
GET /api/messages/:conversationId

Fetch the messages for a specific conversation.
Response example:
POST /api/messages

Send a new message.
Request body example:
GET /api/profile

Fetch the user's profile data to pre-fill the profile form.
Response example:
POST /api/update-profile

Update the user's profile data.
Request body example:
3. Database Schema
a. Conversations Table
Fields:
id: Unique identifier for the conversation.
user1: User ID of the first participant.
user2: User ID of the second participant.
b. Messages Table
Fields:
id: Unique identifier for the message.
conversationId: ID of the conversation.
sender: User ID of the sender.
text: Message content.
timestamp: Time the message was sent.
c. Users Table
Fields:
id: Unique identifier for the user.
fullName: Full name of the user.
email: Email address.
profilePhoto: Path to the profile photo.
Other profile fields (e.g., student, age, telefon, etc.).
4. Frontend-Backend Integration
a. Fetch Profile Data
Use the /api/profile endpoint to pre-fill the profile form when the page loads.
Example:
b. Update Profile
Use the /api/update-profile endpoint to save changes when the user submits the profile form.
Example:
c. Load Conversations
Use the /api/conversations endpoint to populate the conversation list.
Example:
d. Load Messages
Use the /api/messages/:conversationId endpoint to load messages for a specific conversation.
Example:
e. Send Message
Use the /api/messages endpoint to send a new message.
Example:
5. Real-Time Messaging
Use WebSockets (e.g., Socket.IO) to enable real-time updates for new messages.
Example:
6. Testing
Test all features (profile update, messaging, etc.) to ensure they work as expected.
Use tools like Postman to test the backend endpoints.
7. Deployment
Deploy the frontend and backend to a hosting platform (e.g., Vercel for frontend, AWS/Heroku for backend).
Ensure the API endpoints are accessible from the deployed frontend.

1. Backend Implementation
a. Set Up WebSocket Server
Use a library like Socket.IO (Node.js) to handle WebSocket connections.

Install Dependencies:

Update Your Backend:

'
2. Frontend Implementation
a. Connect to WebSocket Server
Use the Socket.IO client library to connect to the WebSocket server.

Install the Client Library:

Update the Messaging Section:

3. Database Integration
To persist messages and retrieve conversation history:

Save Messages:

When a message is sent, save it to the database in the sendMessage event on the server.
Example:
Load Conversation History:

When a user joins a conversation, fetch the conversation history from the database and send it to the client.
Example:
Frontend: Load Conversation History:

Update the chat window with the conversation history when the conversationHistory event is received.
Example:
4. Styling
Add CSS to style the chat window and messages:

5. Testing
Test the messaging feature with multiple users to ensure real-time updates work correctly.
Verify that messages are saved to the database and retrieved correctly when a conversation is loaded.
6. Deployment
Deploy the backend WebSocket server and frontend to a hosting platform.
Ensure the WebSocket server is accessible from the deployed frontend.

TODOs

handle requests

Next Steps:
Backend Integration:

Fetch apartment listings dynamically from the backend.
Use APIs to retrieve landlord details and apartment descriptions.
Map Integration:

Use a mapping library to display apartment locations on the map.
Booking Requests:

Add a form in the modal to allow users to request bookings.
Styling Enhancements:

Improve the modal design to resemble an iOS-like feature.

//apartmentlist

Next Steps:
Backend Integration:

Implement an API endpoint (POST /upload-apartment) to handle the form submission and store the apartment data in the database.
Redirect to Listings:

After successfully storing the data, redirect the user to the apartments-listing.html page.
Dynamic Listings:

Fetch the stored apartment data from the backend and display it dynamically on the apartments-listing.html page.
